# ServiceNest – Project Overview

## 1. Project Summary
ServiceNest is a location‑based service discovery and engagement platform designed to connect **clients** with trusted **local service providers**. The platform focuses on simplicity, trust, and scalability—starting with local markets in **Moncton, NB (including Dieppe and Riverview)** and expanding nationally and globally.

ServiceNest supports three core user roles: **Visitors**, **Clients**, and **Service Providers**, with a powerful **Admin Panel** to manage quality, trust, and growth.

## 2. Problem Statement
Finding reliable local service providers is often fragmented, time‑consuming, and trust‑poor. Clients struggle with:
- Verifying provider credibility
- Comparing services fairly
- Communicating efficiently

Service providers struggle with:
- Visibility in competitive markets
- Managing leads and requests
- Building online reputation

ServiceNest solves this by offering a **centralized, search‑driven, and trust‑focused platform**.
